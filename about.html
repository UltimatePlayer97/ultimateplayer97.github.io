    <strong>So Who Am I?</strong>
    <p>
      My real name will not be revealed (yet). But I am happy to share some of
      my information to you!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="left-margin">
      I am a person who is interested in learning code, and wish for it to be my
      job when I grow up. Right now, I do not have much experience with coding
      and may have trouble making this portfolio.
      <br />
      <br />
      I will use this portfolio to record my progress and see how far I come at
      the end of school (or when I may or may not quit)
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>What Do I Do?</strong>
    <p>
      I am a student of ****** High School, and am learning to be some form
      of computer scientist. As of now, I did not do multimedia for some reason,
      but that will change in Year 11 when I can choose my subjects again.
